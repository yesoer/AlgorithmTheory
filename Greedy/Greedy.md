### Intervals <hr />

#### Interval Scheduling

**Problem :**
From a number of jobs with start and end time choose a subset such that none are 
overlapping and as many are processed as possible.

**Solution :**
Choose the next interval to include by their endtime, earlier ones being the preference.
Of course one should only consider those where the starting time is more or equal to the 
endtime of the lastly chosen Interval.
