### Algorithm Theory <hr />

#### About this project
This is supposed to be a place where I can learn about algorithms,
document this knowledge and test my understanding by implementing them.

#### In this project

1. **Greedy Algorithms**
- Interval Scheduling 
- Interval Partitioning
- Interval Lateness Minimization
- Dijkstra
- Minimal Span Trees (MST)
- Huffman Codes

2. **Divide and Conquer**
- Counting Inversions
- Closest Pair
- Matrix Multiplication
- Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)

3. **Dynamic Programming**
- Weighted Interval Scheduling
- Knapsack
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Shortest Paths (revisited: Bellman Ford)
- Detection of negative circles 

4. **Flow Graphs**
- Maximum Flow (Ford-Fulkerson)
- Circulation in flow graphs

5. **The so called "Challenges"**
Some more specific problems that have been solved by adapting some of
the mentioned Algorithms. They're good challenges but might also help
thinking out of the box.
